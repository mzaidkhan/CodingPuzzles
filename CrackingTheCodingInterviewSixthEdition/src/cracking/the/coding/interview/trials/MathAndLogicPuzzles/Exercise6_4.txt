The ants will not collide if all of them walk in the same direction, either in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction.
Therefore, the probability of ants moving in the same direction is:
	p(All ants moving in same direction) = p(All ants moving in clockwise direction) + p(All ants moving in anti-clockwise direction)
										 = (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^3
										 = 1/4

Hence, the probability of collisions between ants  = (1 - p(all ants moving in the same direction))
												   = 1 - 1/4
												   = 3/4

Generalizing for n vertex polygon; the probability of collision between ants = 1 - p(all ants moving in the same direction)
																			 = 1 - ( (1/2)^N + (1/2)^N)
																			 = 1 - (1/2)^(N-1)
