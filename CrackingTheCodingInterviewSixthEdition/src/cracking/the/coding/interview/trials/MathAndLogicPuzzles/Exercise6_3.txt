An 8 by 8 chess board has 32 white & black squares each. Furthermore, the diagonally opposite sides of a 8 by 8 chess board have the same color.
Hence removing them would mean we are left with either 32 white and 30 black squares or vis-a-vis. 

Hence it is impossible to fit 31 dominoes into the remaining 62 square of the chess board. Since, each domino would require 1 black and 1 white square
to fill two squares. Since there are only 32 of one kind and 30 of another. It is not possible to fill exactly one domino on the chess board,
meaning 2 square of same color are left unfilled with a domino.
