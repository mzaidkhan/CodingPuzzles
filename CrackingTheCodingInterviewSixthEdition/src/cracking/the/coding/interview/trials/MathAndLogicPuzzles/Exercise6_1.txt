Since, we have a constraint of finding the bottle with pills which weight 1.1 grams each in One weighting ONLY.

We can solve this by, 

	Actual weight = 1st bottle * 1 pill + 2nd bottle * 2 pills + 3rd bottle * 3 pills + ... + 20th bottle * 20 pills.

Assuming all the bottles have pills which weight 1 gram each,

	Total weight = 1st bottle * 1 pill + 2nd bottle * 2 pills + 3rd bottle * 3 pills + ... + 20th bottle * 20 pills = 220

Therefore, we can find the bottle which has pills of weight 1.1 gram each with the below formula:

	Bottle with 1.1 gram pills = (Actual weight - 220) grams / 0.1 grams

If bottle 4 has the 1.1 gram pills = (220.4 - 220) / 0.1 = 4
