Assuming there are X blue eyed men among N men on this island. 
It would take X days for the blue eyed men to leave the island and all of them will leave on the same day.

This can be explained as follows: (assuming all the men on the island are intelligent :P)

Case 1: If there was only one blue eyed man on the island. He would look around to check for blue eyed men on the island. 
When the blue eyed man finds out that there are no other blue eyed men, he assumes he is the one and leave the following night.

Case 2: If there were two blue eyed men on the island. These two men would look around to find the blue eyed men. 
They would find only one blue eyed man. So each is unsure if they are blue eyed and wait to check if one of them leaves. 
No one leave that evening. Eventually they leave next evening.

Case 3: Same case here, the three blue eyed men all decide to leave on the 3rd evening.

Generalizing, it takes X days to X blue eyed men to leave the island (they all travel on the same day).
